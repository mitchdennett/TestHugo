## Getting Started

Most applications will require some form of authentication. Masonite comes with a craft command to scaffold out an authentication system for you. This should typically be ran on fresh installation of Masonite since it will create controllers routes and views for you.

We can create an authentication system by running the craft command:

```text
$ craft auth
```

We should get a success message saying that some new assets were created.
