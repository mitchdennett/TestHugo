# Orator ORM

# Introduction

The Orator ORM is an Active Record style ORM that is truly a pleasure to work with. Because Masonite strives on separating migrations and models, an Active Record style ORM is a perfect fit. If you have used PHP's Eloquent ORM then Orator will look remarkably similar. 

Documentation will eventually be migrated to here but for now, you can read the documentation for the [Orator ORM here.](https://orator-orm.com).

## Getting Started

All configuration is inside the `config/database.py` file. The configuration is very straight forward and simply contains a dictionary of databases. Before you start using any models, you should ensure that these database credentials are correct. All configuration settings point to your `.env` file so any basic changes should be made there. We'll explain further configuration settings later in the documentation.
